# Active Directory Home Lab

## Project Overview
This Active Directory home lab simulates a real-world Windows domain environment to demonstrate foundational sysadmin and security skills. This lab includes a domain controller, client workstation, domain users, organizational units, and custom Group Policies.

This enterprise environment was built using VMware Workstation Pro and includes:
- **Windows Server 2019** VM as our Domain Controller
- **Windows 11** VM as the client workstation
- A custom domain 'lab.local'
- Three Organizational Units: **HR**, **IT**, and **Finance** equipped with a test user in each
- Group Policies to enforce security controls and simulate a real-world environment

---

## Objectives
- Configure a working Active Directory domain from scratch
- Create users and organize them into Organizational Units (OUs)
- Add a Windows client to the domain
- Apply Group Policies to enforce user restrictions
